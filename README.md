# AI-Snake

This was a fun side project of mine to integrate AI and the game that I loved playing when I was a kid.

To start:

Run "python q_learning.py p" to play in CMD/Anaconda prompt

But if you want to make some changes like change learning rate , alpha , gamma , be my guest .
If you want to train , just run "python q_learning.py t" in CMD/Anaconda prompt.

Open to suggestions as well.

Thanks!
